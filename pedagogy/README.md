#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce Theoretical Concept: Conversion of a binary data or sequence of bits into a digital signal i.e. Polar RZ and NRZ Line Code; Theoretical Concept. <br>
The Focus area is to familiarize the students to the concepts of “Line Coding” by simulator of experiment and also make them able to convert a binary data into Polar RZ & NRZ Line Codes.


#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level <br>


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to Describe the concept of conversion of binary signal to a Polar RZ or NRZ digital signal (Line Coding). | Understand | Describe
2.| Student will be able to generate a Polar RZ and NRZ digital signal out of a binary sequence given. | Apply | Generate 
3.| Student will be able to compare between Polar RZ and NRZ digital signal on the basis of their characteristics. | Analyze | Compare

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Summative

<u> <b>Description: </b> The instructional strategy which will be implemented in the simulator is as follows: <br>
Students will be able to enter the length of sequence of bits which they want to convert into Polar RZ or NRZ sequence. Students will then enter the binary sequence of the selected length. Then students will select the one of the option out of RZ or NRZ Line code. Based on input binary sequence entered by the students will be then converted into Polar RZ or NRZ digital signal. After completing the experiment student shall answer the asked questions.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to Describe the concept of conversion of binary signal to a Polar RZ or NRZ digital signal (Line Coding). | Student will enter the binary sequence to convert it into Polar RZ or NRZ Line code format. | Polar coding is a technique in which <br> A. 1 is transmitted by a positive pulse and 0 is transmitted by negative pulse^l <b> <br> B. 1 is transmitted by a positive pulse and 0 is transmitted by zero volts <br> C.  None of the above </b> <br>
2.| Student will be able to generate a Polar RZ and NRZ digital signal out of a binary sequence given. | Student will enter the binary sequence to convert it into Polar RZ or NRZ Line code format. | In polar RZ format for coding, symbol '0' is represented by <br> A. Zero voltage <br> B. Negative voltage <br> C.  Pulse is transmitted for half the duration D. Both b) and c) are correct </b> <br>
3.| Student will be able to compare between Polar RZ and NRZ digital signal on the basis of their characteristics. | Student will select both options of Conversion Polar RZ and NRZ one after another and compare the both waveforms. | Between RZ and NRZ encoding techniques RZ requires higher bandwidth : A. <b> True <br> B. False <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will enter the length of binary sequence | Simulator will store the length of binary sequence  | Student is able to find the length of binary sequence.
2.| Student will enter the binary sequence | Simulator will accept the binary sequence  | Purpose is to enter the binary sequence which student want to convert.
3.| Student will select the Option out of RZ or NRZ | Simulator will decide that to which format it will convert the digital data | Purpose is to make a decision to convert binary sequence.
4.| Student will enter the GO button and will get the desired digital sequence | Simulator will convert the entered sequence by student to Polar RZ or NRZ code.  | Purpose is to get the desired digital sequence.
