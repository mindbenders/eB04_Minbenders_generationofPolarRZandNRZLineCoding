### Aim<br>
To Study the generation of Polar RZ and NRZ line codes.
### Theory<br>
Polar coding scheme uses multiple voltage level to represent binary values.

1.NRZ(Non-Return-to-zero):-<br>

  In NRZ Bipolar signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit.

2.RZ (Return-to-zero):-<br>

  In RZ Polar line coding, signal return to zero at the middle of the bit.
### Procedure<br>
In this experiment the simulator starts with the window asking the user to click on the tab of Introduction or experiment. Clicking on Introduction the simulator will provide the conceptual knowledge of Unipolar RZ and NRZ line codes after that user will reach to the experiment part where user is asked to enter the length of the sequence and  the bits of the sequence. In any how, if the user does not enter binary digits or enter mismatch information the simulator will prompt an error showing”enter valid information”,  after clicking the submit button, so the user needs to enter the information carefully. After that user can choose between RZ and NRZ or both and click on submit. Also if the user click on submit button without entering the information, the simulator will again prompt an error.

After submitting the information the simulator will convert the given binary sequence into the Unipolar RZ/NRZ as asked and will generate the graph showing Polar RZ/NRZ line codes.

### Pre Test
### Post Test
<br>
Q 1. What is the advantages Polar line code? <br>
<b>a. Doesn't require a lot of bandwidth for transmission.<br></b>
b. Cheap hardware.<br>
c. The probability of error is much reduced.<br>
d. Both (a) and (c).<br><br>

Q 2. What is the disadvantages of Polar Line code?<br>
a. The signal droop is caused at the places where the signal is non-zero at 0 Hz<br>
b. It is simple. <br>
c. No low-frequency components are present.<br></b>
<b>d. None of the options<br></b>

Q 3. In Polar RZ High in data is represented by which pulse?<br>
<b>a. Mark Pulse<br></b>
b. Square Pulse<br>
c. Sine pulse<br>
d. None Of the above<br>
