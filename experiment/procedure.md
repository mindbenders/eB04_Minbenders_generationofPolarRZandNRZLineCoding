<b>Procedure<br></b>

1. In this experiment the simulator starts with the window asking the user to click on the tab of Introduction or experiment.<br>
2. Clicking on Introduction the simulator will provide the conceptual knowledge of Polar RZ and NRZ line codes after that user will reach to the experiment part where user is asked to enter the length of the sequence and  the bits of the sequence.<br>
3. In any how, if the user does not enter binary digits or enter mismatch information the simulator will prompt an error showing ”enter valid information”, after clicking the submit button, so the user needs to enter the information carefully.<br>
4. After that user can choose between RZ and NRZ or both and click on submit. Also if the user click on submit button without entering the information, the simulator will again prompt an error.<br>
5. After submitting the information the simulator will convert the given binary sequence into the Polar RZ/NRZ as asked and will generate the graph showing Polar RZ/NRZ line codes.
